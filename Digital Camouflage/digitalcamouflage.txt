Given:
We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: https://mega.nz/#!XDBDRAQD!4jRcJvAhMkaVaZCOT3z3zkyHre2KHfmkbCN5lYpiEoY Hint 1: It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture?<br /> Hint 2: If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.

Answer:
Open network caputre file with wireshark and there you can find a supspicious HTP request, if you look at the frame you can find a password and username. The password is encrypted in base64.
