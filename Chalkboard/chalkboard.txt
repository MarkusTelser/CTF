Have to solve equation and know values of x and y.

given:
7x + 9y = 59
3x + 5y = 31

first equation:
3x + 5y = 31
3x = 31 - 5y
x = 31 - 5y / 3

second equation:
7x + 9y = 59
7x = 59 - 9y
x = 59 - 9y / 7

third equation:
31 - 5y / 3 = 59 - 9y / 7
31 - 5y * 7 = 59 - 9y * 3
217 - 35y = 177 - 27y
8y = 40

y = 5
x = 2
